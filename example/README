data_brief.mat contains an exemplar dataset from our database with a 60 second snippet of resting EEG recordings in a FieldTrip compatible format.

Structure should look like:

data = 
  struct with fields:
         label: {66×1 cell}         --- electrode labels (i.e. 63 EEG, 2 EOG, 1 ECG)
    sampleinfo: [48001 120001]      --- time stamps of recording (begin and end)
         trial: {[66×72001 double]} --- actual continuous data (electrode by time)
          time: {[1×72001 double]}  --- time points in seconds
           cfg: [1×1 struct]        --- cfg from fieldTrip (log-keeping), can be empty at beginning
       fsample: 1200                --- sampling rate of recording
